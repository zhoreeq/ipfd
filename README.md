Features:

- Easy file sharing without registration and SMS. Supports images, video and audio files.
- Files are not stored on the disk, but are uploaded to the peer-to-peer [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) network instead.
- IPFS gateway is configurable. Use your own or any other [public gateway](https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/) to host uploaded files.
- RSS feeds.
- Comments and up/down votes.
- Premoderation mode toggle.

## Requirements

- PostgreSQL database
- IPFS node

## Run with docker

```
git clone https://github.com/zhoreeq/ipfd.git && cd ipfd
docker build -t ipfd .
docker-compose up -d
```

The app listens at http://localhost:8000

## Build

- git clone repo
- run `make`

## Install

- install database schema from `migrations/xxx_init.up.sql` file
